- addtional payments webhooks and related logic

    - payment_intent.succeeded:
    This webhook notifies your server when a payment is successfully captured. Use this to update the database and notify users of the payment success.
    
    - payment_intent.payment_failed:
    If a payment fails, Stripe can trigger this event. Use it to notify the user about the failure and suggest alternative payment methods.
    
    - invoice.payment_succeeded & invoice.payment_failed:
    For subscription-based services, these webhooks are essential to ensure proper invoicing and user notifications for payment issues.
    
    - Webhook Security:
    Ensure that your webhook endpoints validate the signature provided by Stripe. This is important to prevent unauthorized or malformed requests.
    
    - Payment Receipt:
    Consider integrating Stripeâ€™s automatic email receipts, or if custom, trigger an email from your system using checkout.session.completed to send detailed payment information.
